Each directory here represents a Traveling Salesman Problem

Each directory contains
    a Methodology folder with:
        map.png: coordinates of the cities
        scores.png: a square matrix of the raw scores, 
                    some scores may be ignored
        a Gradient folder with:
            gradient1.png: a gradient greated from the scores
            gradient2.png: a gradinet created from the scores
            landscape.png: a stretched heightmap created from gradients

        a Tiling folder with:
            pool1.png: a png of pool1 used to create gradient1
            pool2.png: a png of pool2 used to create gradient2
            gradient1.png: the gradient created from pool1
            gradient2.png: the gradient created from pool2
            landscape.png: a heightmap of the landscape created
                           from the gradients before any post-
                           processing
            landscape-post.png: a heightmap after filtering and any other 
                                post-processing
        a Striation folder with:
            landscape.png: a png of the landscape created by
                           filtering the matrix from scores.png
    a Results folder with:
        Clustering-render.tif: a partial rendering of the landscape generated by the
                        clustering method
        Striation-render.tif: a partial rendering of the landscape generated by the
                        striation method
	Clustering.tif: a partial height map of the landscape generated by the 
			clustering method
        Striation.tif: a partial height map of the landscape generated by the
                        striation method
        distribution.png: a histogram of the distribution of the entire
                          problem space
