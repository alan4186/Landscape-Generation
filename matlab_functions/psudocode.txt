init city map with arguments for number of cities and xy coordinates
init first permutation as <1 <2 <3... <n // all directions are set to left

while there is still a mobile city{
    score curent permutation and write to disk

% load scores and put them in a square matrix
scores = 10!x1 matrix of scores to all solutions
square = 1900x1900 matrix of scores

% generate the large features of the landscape
bucket = square with sections of 100x100 rotated randomly
bucket = rotate the entire matrix by ~90
filtered_features = gausian fillter applied to bucket, filter size: 40x40, sigma=300
filtered_features = gausian fillter applied to filtered_features, filter size: 40x40, sigma=300

% generate 'noise' to apply to the large features
noise = square rotated ~90 with the sine rotate function
noise = gausian fillter applied to square, filter size: 5x5, sigma=3
noise = gausian fillter applied to noise, filter size: 5x5, sigma=3
normalize nosise to -1 1 and scale to given scale factor

sum the large_features matrix and the noise matrix
