% MATLAB style psudo code
% This is psudo code for the interactive vesion of the clustering/gradient method
% 10 city example

%call executable to generate scores
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
compute scores of all points using Johonson Trotter algorithm
write scores to file
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

space = resahpe all scores into rectangle

% initialize gradients
g1 = zero matrix the size of space
g2 = zero matrix the size of space

row = number of rows in space
col = number of columns in space
% use sections of space 100x20 to create gradients
for i = 1:25:col-25
    for j = 1:25: row-100
        section = the scores at i,j to i+99,j+19
        
        randomly rotate section

        randomly place rotated section in g1
        with bottom left corner somewhere 
        in range i,j to i+10,j+10
        
        randomly rotate section again

        randomly place rotated section in g2
        with bottom left corner somewhere 
        in range i,j to i+10,j+10

    end for j
end for i

landscape = integrate g1,g2 with poisson image editing
