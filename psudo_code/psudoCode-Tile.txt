% MATLAB style psudo code
% This is psudo code for the interactive vesion of the clustering/gradient method
% 10 city example

call executable to generate scores
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
compute scores of the nessesary permutations
 and write them to the file SpaceScores.txt
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% load scores and put them in a square matrix
square = swuare matrix of raw scores the size of the space to be rendered

% choose 2 secions to pull height values from
pool1 = rectangle matrix, side length ratio 10:1 row:col
pool2 = rectangle matrix, side length ratio 10:1 row:col

% create 2 gradient sections by placing strips on a square 
% matrix at random angles
gradient=square zero matrix, same number of rows/colums as pool rows
for i=1:60
    strip=create_strip(pool1)
    rotate strip by a random angle
    gradient = sum strip and gradient
end
repeat to create second gradient


% edges of the small section must be defined because the 
% gradients of the entire space are not computed so some information
% is unknown.
% any arbitary function will work
edges=sine wave

%integrate the gradients with poisson system of equations
landscape = inverseGradient(edges, gradient1,gradient2)












function create_strip(pool)
    strip=a matrix the same size as pool initialized to the mean of pool
    
    reshape pool into a column vector
    % iterate through every point
    for point in strip 
        tmp= a point in pool within a given range...
        of the mean of the neighborhood of point
       
        point = tmp
        remove tmp from pool
    end
    return strip
    end
